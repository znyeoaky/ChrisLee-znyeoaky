            Li was announced the ambassador for Gucci Timepieces and Jewelry in
            Asia in Jun 2016. In the same year, Li released her seventh studio
            album, Growing Wild. Li broke with tradition by separating the new
            album into four EPs. She invited producers she had never worked with
            before, like Hsia Yu, Wyman Wong and Chen Weilun. The first EP,
            Wild, sold 3 million copies in 16 days after it was released in May
            of last year. The three other EPs were then released within six
            months, with total sales of more than 6.5 million copies, grossing
            over 32.8 million yuan ($4.73 million) in 2016. According to Andy
            Wai Lam Ng, the vice-president of Tencent Music Entertainment Group,
            Growing Wild achieved China's highest digital music sales since the
            company released the first Chinese digital album in December 2014.
